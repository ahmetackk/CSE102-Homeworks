  The segmantation fault encountered in the part of the puzzle where the computer finishes the puzzle by making random moves (auto_finish function) was solved by changing ulimit size in the makefile.
  Just in case if it doesn't work, another function (pc_finish function) has been added to finish the puzzle with moves made by the computer.
  The outputs of both are in the outputs folder.
